# Apply OSRM to Norway

This project uses the `orsm` package in R and computes distances and times between Norway cities.\

## Installation

> Install `osrm` [website]("https://project-osrm.org).

## How to compute distances?

The package only needs origins and destinations in `sf` format.

## Output

The output is either in matrix format, but also in shapefile.

This ShinyApp [here](https://dz683z-mateo.shinyapps.io/osrm_norway) shows the result!
